## Paragraph
 I have heard and seen a lot of industries be impacted and reduce the amount of people in their workflow just as computers and basic technology was introduced. However, computers and basic tech equipment still require people to operate them. I think it's interesting and potentially scary to see how AI will transform this and possibly reduce the employee count again-- although I'm sure they still require people to maintain them. Especially, because these jobs will require people with different experience to its prior employees and likely a greater degree of education to operate them. Additionally, it'll be interesting to see how dependent or resistant companies will be to these newfound systems and resources.
